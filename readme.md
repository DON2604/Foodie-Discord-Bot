## 👩‍🍳 How It Works

RecipeBot listens for messages on your Discord server. To get recipe suggestions, mention the bot with a list of ingredients separated by commas.

Example: **@Foodie-Bot** tomatoes, chicken, rice

The bot will respond with a list of recipes you can make with the provided ingredients. <br>
